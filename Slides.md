Title:
- Hacking Health Education

Objectives
- Explore barriers to collaboration and inclusion in medical education.
- Acknowledge the need for educators and learners to feel fulfilled in each of their endeavors.
- Show how other industries have promoted collaboration and personal fulfillment with a shift in culture and tooling.
- Suggest approaches to adapting an open source mindset to medical education.
- Create a module on a topic of interest using an online platform for sharing audio, video, files, and references.


Collaboration and Inclusion
- What does it mean to be collaborative?
- open, inclusive, welcoming, friendly
- What are some barriers we face to collaboration?
- copyright and patent concerns, organizational barriers, who owns what
- How do we overcome those barriers?

Hallmarks of collaboration
- Makes us happy
- Distributes work
- Reduces barriers to entry
- Invites involvement

How to Read a Paper (4th ed.)
Trisha Greenhalgh
"While the need of health care professionals for information of the best quality has never been greater, barriers abound: lack of time, lack of facilities, lack of searching skills, lack of motivation, and (perhaps worst of all) information overload."

Silence is not Golden: Making Collaborations Work (Schwartz JP, PhD, NINDS)
https://ori.hhs.gov/silence-not-golden-making-collaborations-work
"For many of us, the pleasure of doing science lies in formal and informal discussion and exchange of results and ideas with colleagues."

Seeking fulfillment as educators and students
- Take this for granted: we are all extremely motivated educators and learners
- And this: we have each either experienced or witnessed disappointment in our roles as teachers or students

Respect each person's drive and potential
- Basically rehash of community guidelines

What is open source?
- OSI definition
- In the tech industry, open source usually refers to software
- Learning materials and methods are the source code of medical education

Why open source?

Examples of open source success
- Wikipedia vs Encarta
- Linux vs Windows
- Bitcoin vs traditional currency

Software tooling
- Content: code, documentation, project management
- Version control system: Git, VCS, Subversion - collaborately iterate code
- Collaboration platforms: GitHub, BitBucket, SourceForge - distribute and discuss code
- Package managers: NPM, apt... - discover and install code
- Licenses: MIT, GPL - conditions for use and distribution of code
- Institutional support: Microsoft, IBM, The Linux Foundation, etc - sponsoring development and freeing employees to contribute

What are some potential targets of open source in medicine?
- hardware
- software
- education
- evidence-based medicine
- discussion
- original research

Isn't medical education open source already?
Of course!
- Original research methods and results are published
- Synthesized data is shared at non-profit and commercial conferences
- Professional organizations provide guidance on a wide range of issues
But...
- Not all data is published
- Conferences are expensive
- Professional organizations are exclusive
Then again...
- Few of the obstacles to open source education apply to individuals

Education tooling
- Content: media (documents, slides, audio, video, text) and references
- Version control system: Git?
- Collaboration platforms: Wikipedia, EverNote, Google Docs
- Package managers: ?
- Licenses: CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-ND...

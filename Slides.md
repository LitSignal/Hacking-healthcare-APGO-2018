Collaboration and Inclusion
- What does it mean to be collaborative?
- open, inclusive, welcoming, friendly
- What are some barriers we face to collaboration?
- copyright and patent concerns, organizational barriers, who owns what
- How do we overcome those barriers?

Hallmarks of collaboration
- Makes us happy
- Distributes work
- Reduces barriers to entry
- Invites involvement

Seeking fulfillment as educators and students
- Take this for granted: we are all extremely motivated educators and learners
- And this: we have each either experienced or witnessed disappointment in our roles as teachers or students

Respect each person's drive and potential
- Basically rehash of community guidelines

What is open source?
- OSI definition
- In the tech industry, open source usually refers to software
- Learning materials and methods are the source code of medical education

Examples of open source success
- Wikipedia vs Encarta is a good one
- Linux
- Bitcoin

Isn't medical education open source already?
- It is and it isn't
- Scientific research methods and results are published, sort of
- We're all here at this conference to share with and learn from one another
- We all have this basic drive to do education better
